_**Sentiment Analysis Project**_

**OVERVIEW**
This project implements a Sentiment Analysis tool that analyzes text data to determine the sentiment expressed withiin it. This tool utlizes machine learning algorithms to classify sentiments as positive and negative, providing valuable insights into user opinions and emotions.

**FEATURES**
1. _Text Classification_ : Classify text into positive and negative statements.
2. _User-Friendly Interface_ : Easy to use interface for inputting text and viewing results (using Hugging Face API)
3. _Customizable Models_ :Allows users to train their own models with custom datasets.

**INSTALLATION**
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:
1. Download the Python code along with the dataset containing 50k movie reviews.
2. You can also download the dataset using the following link : https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/
3. Train the dataset on different machine learning models and perform hyper parameter tuning to improve your training and model robustness.
